## Guava Kata
Inspired by the idea of the coding kata for the [GS collections kata](https://github.com/goldmansachs/gs-collections-kata) (now renamed to Eclipse Collections), this kata provides some exercises to get familiar with the core concepts and functions of the guava library.

### Basic idea
The kata provides different exercises with class constructs and some tests. After refactoring by using features of the guava library the tests should still pass. Hints are included in the Javadoc.

But first of all have a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki).

An additional hint for users of Java 7+. Some of the features provided by guava are directly in the JDK API (e.g. Objects in 1.7, Optional in 1.8 etc..), so some of the exercises can be solved in different ways. Additional hints are in the Javadoc.
### Prerequisites
At least Java 6 has to be installed to run the kata. The project can be imported in any IDE having gradle support (eg. Eclipse or Intellij). That's it!
